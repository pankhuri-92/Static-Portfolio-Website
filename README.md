## DESCRIPTION OF TASK 1 

As part of my software development internship, I was assigned the task of building a static website for a developer's portfolio using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of this task was to design and develop a responsive, visually appealing, and functional website that represents a developer’s professional profile, skills, and projects, while providing users an intuitive browsing experience across different devices.

I approached this task by first outlining the core sections typically expected in a developer’s portfolio — Home, About, Projects, Contact, and Footer — and then translating that structure into a responsive scroll-down website layout. I ensured the site followed modern UI/UX principles, provided clear navigation, and highlighted important information about the developer in a well-organized manner.

The navigation bar sits at the top and remains accessible throughout. On the left side, I included a profile picture along with the developer’s name — “Pankhuri Asthana” — and on the right, clearly labeled links for Home, About, Projects, and Contact. This sticky navbar makes it easy for visitors to jump to any section of the page.

The landing dashboard (Home section) greets the visitor with a warm heading: "Hi, this is Pankhuri Asthana", followed by a concise two-line introduction that establishes the developer’s professional identity. A “View Projects” button is placed just below this, which smoothly scrolls the user to the Projects section when clicked, enhancing navigation.

Next comes the About Me section, which I split into two distinct halves to make it both readable and visually balanced. The left half features a heading titled “Get to Know Me” followed by a descriptive paragraph detailing who I am, my interests, and goals as a developer. A “Contact Me” button is included here to allow direct navigation to the Contact section. The right half showcases my technical skillset in the form of neatly styled small rectangles with rounded corners. This skill cloud allows recruiters and collaborators to quickly gauge my proficiency in different tools and languages.

The Projects section follows, introduced by a heading and a brief explanation of the work I’ve done. Each project is presented individually in a vertical layout, with the following elements:

- A short project description that outlines the idea and objective

- A list of the technologies used

- An image or screenshot that gives a visual impression of the project

- A GitHub link that opens the source code for further exploration

This format not only highlights my practical experience but also demonstrates my ability to document and present my work in a professional manner.

The final section is the Contact form. Visitors can fill in their name, email, and message to get in touch for inquiries, collaboration, or opportunities. I made sure the form is intuitive, easy to use, and styled to blend well with the rest of the site. Basic form validation using JavaScript ensures no field is left empty before submission.

The footer rounds off the website and contains my name again along with links to my social media profiles, providing alternate means of communication or networking.

The entire website is fully responsive, meaning it adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes — from desktops to tablets to smartphones. This was achieved using flexbox layouts, media queries, and responsive units in CSS.

Overall, this task allowed me to combine frontend design skills with practical development. I learned how to structure a personal brand on the web, how to prioritize content hierarchically, and how to write modular, reusable HTML/CSS/JS code. The website is clean, efficient, and showcases me as a capable and creative developer ready for future opportunities.
